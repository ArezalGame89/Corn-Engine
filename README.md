# Corn Engine
CE is a standalone Framework/Modification/Engine powered by [PyKern](https://github.com/Kiffolisk/pykern) and Completely recoded

*[NitrogenDioxide](https://github.com/Kiffolisk) is the owner of PyKern, This engine had no profit/affiliation with PyKern .
moreover, this engine was not made to mock or attack NitrogenDioxide*
# Installation
NO! It's not running ```setup.py``` and say it's good.
Basically run ```boot.py``` and it will check the ```info.corndata``` if it's installed,
If you want to reinstall CE, open ```info.corndata``` and change 1 to 0 and run ```boot.py``` again
# Installation (Manual)
For Debugging purposes, here's a step-by-step guide on how to install it yourself

1. If it doesn't exist, make these files in /user:

2.Open ```cornname``` and type your username:
```
Here you can put your single-line username. make sure it's not empty


```

3.Open ```donotlook``` and type in your password:

```Python
# You can make your password whatever in a single line. CE will NOT read anymore lines
```
4.Lastly, open ```info.corndata``` and replace ```0``` with `1`
You can also type in ```debugVerbose``` to trace and debug but that's still not gonna work

And you should be done! Open `boot.py` and if it doesn't work, Retrace the steps to make sure you've done correctly
# How to open
Just click ```boot.py``` and you're good! no need to open command prompt and type the filename

# Requirements

A good PC

A working Python 3+ intrepeter

Windows (It has rough compatiblity for linux but still)

The Files required (all the files in /user, otherwise it will crash)
